simple test audio-link app 
heavly WIP
able send raw packages with DATA 
todo:
read data in packages using esp32/ linux



It sounds like you're working on a project to create a simple audio-link application using ESP32 and Linux, where you can send raw audio data packages between the two platforms. Here's an expanded project description with some guidance on what you might need to do:

Project Description: Simple Audio-Link App

Overview:
The goal of this project is to create a basic audio-link application that allows you to send and receive raw audio data packages between an ESP32 microcontroller and a Linux-based system. This project will help you understand the fundamentals of audio data transmission and reception.

Project Components:

Hardware Setup:

ESP32 Microcontroller: You will need an ESP32 development board.
Linux-based System: This could be a Raspberry Pi, PC, or any other Linux-based device.
Communication Protocol:

Decide on a communication protocol for transferring audio data between the ESP32 and Linux system. You can use WiFi, Bluetooth, or even a wired connection like UART, I2C, or SPI, depending on your requirements.
Audio Data Encoding:

You will need to choose an audio data format, such as PCM (Pulse Code Modulation), to encode the audio data. The ESP32 will capture and encode audio data before sending it to the Linux system.
ESP32 Side:

Set up the ESP32 to capture audio data from a microphone or other audio source.
Encode the captured audio data into packages and transmit them to the Linux system.
Implement error-checking and packetization as needed for reliable data transmission.
Linux Side:

Receive the audio data packages from the ESP32.
Decode the received audio data.
Play the audio on the Linux system's audio output or save it to a file for further processing.
User Interface (Optional):

Create a simple user interface on the Linux side to start/stop the audio transmission, adjust settings, and monitor the received audio data.
To-Do List:

ESP32 Side:

Implement audio capture and encoding.
Set up the communication protocol for data transmission.
Implement packetization and error-checking.
Linux Side:

Implement the communication protocol to receive data from the ESP32.
Decode and play the received audio data.
User Interface:

Develop a basic user interface for control and monitoring.
Testing and Debugging:

Rigorously test the audio-link application for reliability and performance.
Debug any issues that arise during testing.
Documentation:

Document the project, including hardware connections, software setup, and code explanations.
Provide clear instructions for others who may want to replicate or expand upon your project.
Resources and Technologies:

ESP32 programming using the Arduino IDE or ESP-IDF.
Linux programming with C/C++ or Python, depending on your preference.
Audio data encoding and decoding libraries.
Communication protocols and networking (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, UART, etc.).
Remember that this is a high-level project description, and the specific implementation details will depend on your chosen hardware, programming languages, and communication protocols. Additionally, audio processing and real-time data transmission can be complex, so it's essential to break down the project into smaller tasks and tackle them step by step to achieve your goals.# esp32-audio-link
